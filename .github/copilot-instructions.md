This is a C# WPF application project with asynchronous worker threads. When working with this codebase:

- Use C# and WPF coding conventions and best practices
- Follow .NET naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields)
- Use proper async/await patterns for asynchronous operations
- Implement thread-safe operations when working with shared resources
- Use Dispatcher.Invoke for UI updates from background threads
- Follow MVVM pattern where appropriate for WPF applications
- Handle proper disposal of resources (timers, threads, etc.)
- Write clean, readable code with appropriate comments
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Handle exceptions appropriately in async contexts
